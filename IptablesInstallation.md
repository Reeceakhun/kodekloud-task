# Iptables Installation and Configuration
We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 6100 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:



1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.


2. Block incoming port 6100 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.


3. Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

# Solution
Install iptables  
`yum install  -y iptables-services`  

start and enable the installed iptables  
`systemctl start iptables && systemctl enable iptables`  

Add iptable rules  
`iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 172.16.238.14 --destination-port 6100 -j ACCEPT`  
`iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 6100 -j DROP`  
`iptables -L --line-numbers`  
`iptables -R INPUT 5 -p icmp -j REJECT`  

Save iptables rules to ensure they remain persistent across reboot.  
`service iptables save`

Restart iptables for persistence across reboot.  
` systemctl restart iptables && systemctl status iptables`
