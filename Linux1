There was some users data copied on Nautilus App Server 2 at /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. Later they found that they mistakenly mixed up different user data there. Now they want to filter out some user data and copy it to another location. Find the details below:


On App Server 2 find all files (not directories) owned by user yousuf inside /home/usersdata directory and copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) to /news directory.

Solution
find /home/usersdata/ -type f -user john -exec cp --parents {} /news \;



After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.


Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd

On Nautilus storage server in Stratos DC, there is a storage location named /data, which is used by different developers to keep their data (non confidential data). One of the developers named john has raised a ticket and asked for a copy of their data present in /data/john directory on storage server. /home is a FTP location on storage server itself where developers can download their data. Below are the instructions shared by the system admin team to accomplish this task.


a. Make a john.tar.gz compressed archive of /data/john directory and move the archive to /home directory on Storage Server.

sudo tar -czvf john.tar.gz /data/john
sudo mv john.tar.gz /home

There are new requirements to automate a backup process that was performed manually by the xFusionCorp Industries system admins team earlier. To automate this task, the team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they did not make it executable on one the app server i.e App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.


Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3. Also make sure every user can execute it.

sudo chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

The Nautilus security team performed an audit on all servers present in Stratos DC. During the audit some critical data/files were identified which were having the wrong permissions as per security standards. Once the report was shared with the production support team, they started fixing the issues one by one. It has been identified that one of the files named /etc/resolv.conf on Nautilus App 1 server has wrong permissions, so that needs to be fixed and the correct ACLs needs to be set.


1. The user owner and group owner of the file should be root user.

2. Others must have read only permissions on the file.

3. User ravi must not have any permission on the file.

4. User garrett should have read only permission on the file.

sudo chown root:root /etc/resolv.conf
chmod 774 /etc/resolv.conf
setfacl -m u:ravi:000 /etc/resolv.conf
sudo setfacl -m u:garrett:r -R /etc/resolv.conf

11. 
The backup server in the Stratos DC contains several template XML files used by the Nautilus application. However, these template XML files must be populated with valid data before they can be used. One of the daily tasks of a system admin working in the xFusionCorp industries is to apply string and file manipulation commands!


Replace all occurances of the string Sample to Submarine on the XML file /root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.

sed -i 's/Sample/Submarine/g' /root/nautilus.xml

One of the Nautilus developers has copied confidential data on the jump host in Stratos DC. That data must be copied to one of the app servers. Because developers do not have access to app servers, they asked the system admins team to accomplish the task for them.


Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 at location /home/data.

scp -r thor@jump_host:/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg tony@172.16.238.10:/home/data/

To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions on crontab access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs. Limit crontab access to below specified users on App Server 1.


Allow crontab access to ammar user and deny the same to garrett user.

Cd /etc/
Touch cron.deny
Touch cron.allow
Systemctl restart crond.service
Add the usernames accordingly

New tools have been installed on the app servers in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. Therefore, there are some requirements for these app servers as below.


On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter, change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default. Please do not try to reboot these servers after completing this

sudo systemctl set-default runlevel5.target


During the daily standup, it was pointed out that the timezone across Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter doesn't match with that of the local datacenter's timezone, which is Pacific/Chatham.


Correct the mismatch.
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Pacific/Chatham

The system admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed an issue with some servers in Stratos Datacenter where some of the servers are not in sync w.r.t time. Because of this, several application functionalities have been impacted. To fix this issue the team has started using common/standard NTP servers. They are finished with most of the servers except App Server 2. Therefore, perform the following tasks on this server:


1. Install and configure NTP server on App Server 2.

2. Add NTP server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 2.

3. Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we don't want these changes to be applied right now.

sudo yum install ntp
sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf

The Nautilus system admins team recently deployed a web UI application for their backup utility running on the Nautilus backup server in Stratos Datacenter. The application is running on port 8089. They have firewalld installed on that server. The requirements that have come up include the following:


Open all incoming connection on 8089/tcp port. Zone should be public

sudo systemctl status firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8089/tcp â€“permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload


On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:


a. soft limit = 1025

b. hard_limit = 2027

sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf

The xFusionCorp Industries security team recently did a security audit of their infrastructure and came up with ideas to improve the application and server security. They decided to use SElinux for an additional security layer. They are still planning how they will implement it; however, they have decided to start testing with app servers, so based on the recommendations they have the following requirements:


Install the required packages of SElinux on App server 3 in Stratos Datacenter and disable it permanently for now; it will be enabled after making some required configuration changes on this host. Don't worry about rebooting the server as there is already a reboot scheduled for tonight's maintenance window. Also ignore the status of SElinux command line right now; the final status after reboot should be disabled.

sudo yum install selinux-policy-targeted
sudo yum install selinux-policy-devel policycoreutils
sudo touch /.autorelabel
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
