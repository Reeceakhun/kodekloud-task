An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image nginx:1.17 with the latest updates.


Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the nginx:1.17 image. The deployment is named nginx-deployment.

Ensure all pods are operational post-update.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster

# Solution
`kubectl get deployments`  
to get the container name    
`kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml`    
`kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.18`      
`kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment`
